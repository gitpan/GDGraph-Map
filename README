This package extends GD::Graph. It's allow generates 
HTML map text for some graph objects.

To install, first install GD::Graph module (it available on CPAN).
Then cd to the directory that contains this README file 
and type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL

If you wish to install this bundle somewhere other than the default
location then type something like:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

Then to build run make

    make

If you have write access to the install directory (or the one
specified by PREFIX) then you can now type:

    make install

And when make (or before) make samples:

    make samples

Presuming that the install target is in your PERL5LIB path then you
are now ready to use GD::Graph::Map. Enjoy!
